# Solar System Simulation Project
 
This project was created to simulate the N-body problem. The program plots the Earth in the center, the Moon to the right, and a small satellite orbiting the Moon. The program keeps the Earth in focus and plots the path taken as the Moon and satellite orbit the Earth.
